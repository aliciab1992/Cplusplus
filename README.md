# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was to write a function to calculate bank balances without a monthly deposit. Then create two methods to calculate bank balances with a monthly deposit and format a table of values for display.

# What did you do particularly well?
I think I did well on writing a function to calculate the bank balances.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I felt like the code was showing so good progress, though I did have trouble in certain areas. I felt like time played a lot in developing this code and it felt rushed. if I were to have taken more time with this code I would have been able to see better results.
# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The couple of pieces of code that I found most challenging to write were trying to loop the code which I have been having problems with and still have troubling understanding. The other part was trying to display the input values.
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?
The skills from this project that would be transferable to other projects is being about calculating values. This skill with be very important not only in my other projects but in my chosen career path. 
# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Though it could be better if I added more time to fix any mistakes I was able to make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable was making sure I added notes to show how each section of the code works and making sure it was able to run with minimal errors.
